## Problem Statement

Marketplaces (Amazon, Airbnb, Etsy) are used daily everywhere and have changed e-commerce. A marketplace is a platform where multiple vendors sell their products or services to a customer base. The role of a marketplace owner is to bring together vendors and customer to drive sales through a multi-vendor platform. Sellers have a place to gain visibility and sell their products. They benefit from increased discoverability and established infrastructure that translates into faster customer acquisition and conversion. Marketplaces are customer centric and convenient to use. Think of the experience of ordering on Uber Eats and not having to enter your address or payment details every time and having access to all local restaurants vs ordering directly from a restaurant. But this comes with significantly reduced profit margins since they are continuosly paying a high cost to rent space on these platforms. The marketplace owner earns a commission from each sale. Entrepreneurs don't own their customer relationships and data depend on these expensive platforms to survive. An online store, on the other hand, is a single store selling its own products online (Apple, Nike). All marketing and operations are managed by the company that owns the website and products.

## Question
How might you build a solution that allows for entrepreneurs to benefit from the marketplace strengths while also maximizing their profits and longevity by truly owning their customer relationships and not only relying on the marketplace to survive?
